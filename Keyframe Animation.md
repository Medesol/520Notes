Modeling, Rigging and Animation:
- Modeling: decide the neutral shape of the object
- Rigging: Decide the control knobs and what do they do
- Animation: Decide how to vary the knobs to generate desired motion

Modeling and Rigging are more specialized and people doing that are fewer.

The distinction of Riging and Animation is fuzzy. Because 不是很好决定joints的数量，这会影响animating的难度，所以需要两边更多的沟通。 Rigger和Modeler也很紧密

Techniques:
- Traditional(frame by frame)
- Keyframing: Specify some key frames and interpolate
- Procedural techniques: completely generated by computer, no human specify
- Behavioral techniques (subset of procedural): 
- Performance based (motion capture): 
- Physically based (subset of procedural):

## Keyframe 
3D下的keyframe之间的插值比2D之下要简单，虽然最终输出的是2D画面

### Squash
### Slow in and out
把重要的帧附近变慢
### Anticipation
The preparation of an action.
### Follow-through
opposed to anticipation, end an action and establish the relation to the next action.
### Secondary Action
action that results from other actions. e.g hair and clothes.
