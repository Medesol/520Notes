3 methods to animate human skeleton:
- Motion capture (Performance based)
- keyframe animation
- procedural

## Optical 
- Passive optical: the markers are not intelligent
	- 不放在肌肉上，影响骨骼
- Active technology: markers emit different colors

Why still passive method more popular
- color different depending on the lighting
- camera must in rgb color but not grayscale
	- need more memory and throughput
	- 同样的价钱可以得到更高分辨率的灰度摄像机

## Electromagnetic
缺点：
- accelerometer are not very precise.  much more noise
- 其中一些技术需要额外佩戴processor which will affect motion

NOITOM: get rid of backpack
## Exoskeleton
穿外骨架
- impeding and modify motion.
- the angles are very very precise
